Really happy today. Several week ago I read about [Google Dev Library](https://devlibrary.withgoogle.com) program and tried to submit some my samples. I chose Multiplatform-DI library and a sample project with common clean architecture and business-logic and common DI. Today I received a mail that both my samples were added in Dev library into [Android/Kotlin categories](https://devlibrary.withgoogle.com/authors/anioutkazharkova). And I became a Google Dev Library contributor.

If you have your own projects and code that show how to use some Google technology, you can also try to [submit them in](https://forms.gle/E54pxK3JzpXMGyqN7)
